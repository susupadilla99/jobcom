JobCom is a platform that aims to help Tech International Students in Australia to showcase their talents through a stand-out portfolio. 

It is a platform where recruiters can easily find valuable candidates for their companies, and international students can easily showcase their abilities and qualifications through their portfolios to land jobs.

## User Stories

- As a graduate web developer, I want to show the value of my work, not just some line of experience, so that they can fully evaluate how good I am.
- As a fresher product designer, I want to showcase my past projects and experiences to the recruiter, so that they will know what level I am at.
- As a graduate student, I want to have more connections and understand the working environment, so I can quickly adapt with the new work.
- As a recruiter looking for international applicants, I want to ensure that all the applicants that I recruit will fit in with our culture, so that they will feel at home and deliver the best at their new working place.
- As an employer, I want to make sure that students are job-ready for my company to reduce the training fee.
